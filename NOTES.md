- ✅ : done
- 🚧 : WIP
- ⛌ : ERROR
- ❒ : TODO

## 🍅 Pomodoro 1

❒ go through the code and understand how it works, renaming and extracting methods as needed
Did not seem necessary, the code is quite readable and understandable, but the assignment not yet for me.

## 🍅 Pomodoro 2

[x] read the requirements again and understand what is needed to be done
[x] create 'application' directory and move the code there except 'index'
[x] New index test to get the vehicles, make it pass with hardcoded data
